# Movies-ETL

## Overview
Using Python in Jupyter notebooks, with PostgreSQL. Movies data from 3 files (2 csv, 1 json) needed to be imported and cleaned before combining and exporting. Cleaning involved looking for duplicate/redundant column, columns with missing/bad data, and using regular expressions to match patterns in strings.
